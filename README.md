Although there were time constraints that affected the final quality of the code, I ensured to implement comprehensive error handling, particularly for scenarios like loss of internet connectivity. This project served as a valuable platform for me to demonstrate my proficiency in Android development, emphasizing the creation of clean, production-ready code while adhering to industry best practices.
